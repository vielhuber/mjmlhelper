# ðŸŒˆ mjmlhelper ðŸŒˆ

mjmlhelper is a little toolbox for [mjml](https://mjml.io/) (v4.X) that...

-   sends mails from the command line for testing and production,
-   automatically inlines or uploads images for testing purposes,
-   converts your template to the drag&drop editors of [CleverReach](https://www.cleverreach.com) and [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com).

it also includes a small boilerplate and some nifty updates for mjml.

## installation

```
npm init -y
npm install mjmlhelper
```

## setup

```
cp -r ./node_modules/mjmlhelper/boilerplate/. .
```

    "port": 465,
    "ssl": "tls",

    "to": "to@tld.com",
    "to": ["to@tld.com", "to2@tld.com"],
    "to": "list.txt",

    "images": false,
    "images": "inline",
    "images": "upload",

    "log": "log.txt",
    "ftp": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 21,

## notes

### mailchimp

creating mailchimp emails in their classic editor can be a bit tedious. a first block is created by default and you can only create more blocks by duplicating the first one and choosing any other variant. if there is only one block left, it cannot be deleted.

images must be sized (width is crucial) exactly as mentionned in the image edit mask (Content Studio).
